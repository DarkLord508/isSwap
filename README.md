<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As our intake of information through digital media has increased, new problems have arisen. Over time with technological advancements people have found ways to use technology to falsify information and spread it to achieve personal vendetta. One of such practices is called ‘Deep-Fake’[1]. Deep Fake is a technique in which a video of a person’s face or body has been digitally altered so that they appear to be saying or doing something which they actually never have said or done. Deep Fakes are created by combining and superimposing existing images or videos using a deep learning technique known as GANs.
</p>
<h2> Objective </h2>
<p> isSwap? attempts to protect people from believing in false information which is being spread through these deep-fakes by identifying such videos using different tools and technology. It is a web application which uses deep learning techniques to achieve its goal which is to help the user determine the authenticity of a given video.
